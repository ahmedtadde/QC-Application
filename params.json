  "body": "# User Interface for Paper Reports QC\r\nA fun project that I worked on to facilitate the data QC process at The American Institutes of Research, D.C. \r\nThe application is built using Shiny, which is a web application framework for R. This application can be freely used by\r\nData QC Assistants working at A.I.R. The application fully runs locally (on your machine/computer) with no required connection to any external server or the internet.\r\n\r\n# Two Easy Steps To Launch The Application ( 5 minutes or Less)\r\n### 1- Install (or Update to) the latest version of R\r\nGo to this [page](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and download the latest version of R available for your operating system (Windows).\r\nOpen the downloaded file and follow the simple installation instructions.\r\n\r\n### 2- Open R and Launch the App\r\nOpen your newly installed/updated R software. Copy the following lines of code:\r\n```\r\n# Install and Load Pacman library\r\nif(!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\",dependencies = T)\r\nlibrary(pacman)\r\n\r\n# Install OR Load shiny & tm libraries\r\np_load('shiny')\r\np_load('tm')\r\n\r\n# Run Application\r\nrunGitHub(\"QC-Application\",\"ahmedtadde\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nPaste into the R console and press \"ENTER\" (or \"RETURN\" for Macs). You may be prompted to choose a \"CRAN Repository\" for the installation of the required libraries/functions (choose one of the US options). Once all required libraries/functions are automatically installed and loaded, the application will launch and be ready for use in your browser. That's it!\r\n\r\n# For Issues, Questions, Comments and Suggestions\r\nI can be reached via Lync (for people at A.I.R) as Tadde, Ahmed. I can also be reached by email: ahmedtadde@gmail.com\r\n",
